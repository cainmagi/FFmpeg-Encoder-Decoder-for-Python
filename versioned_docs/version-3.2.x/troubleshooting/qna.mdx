### The balance between vulnerability and compatibility

* **Question**: Is it OK to report a security vulnerability issue?

* **Answer**: Sure, because the FFMpeg used in the Linux version is compiled by myself. A good example can be found [<InlineIcon icon={octIssueClosed16}/> here #4](https://github.com/cainmagi/FFmpeg-Encoder-Decoder-for-Python/issues/4). However, there is an exception case. For most dependencies, I can pack them together with the release of `mpegCoder`. But some essenstial libraries, like `GLibC` is impossible to be loaded locally. In this case, the compatibility is more important than the vulnerability. For example, if a newer `GlibC` version can solve a vulnerability issue, but it is only provided in the devel versions of the Debian / Ubuntu releases, I will prefer to preserve the current low version. If I bump into a new version, users with a stable Debian / Ubuntu releases may have to compile `GlibC` before using `mpegCoder`.

### Plan for audio processing {#plan-for-audio-processing}

* **Question**: The audio processing is not supported by `mpegCoder 3.x`. Will it be implemented future?

* **Answer**: Sure. The audio processing would be supported since `mpegCoder 4.x`. But I do not have enough time on this project, so it may take a long time to implement. I am very glad if there is anyone willing to send me a pull request (PR) about this.

### Plan for no-encoding streaming {#plan-for-no-encoding-streaming}

* **Question**: In `mpegCoder 3.x`, `MpegServer` only support streaming while encoding. Will there be a class for reading a video while pushing it as a stream?

* **Answer**: No. I believe that using the official FFMpeg is a good enough solution. We recommend users to use a server program together with the official [FFMpeg<IconExternalLink/>][link-ffmpeg-stream] streaming features.

### Commercial plan {#commercial-plan}

* **Question**: Will there be a commercial plan for `mpegCoder`?

* **Answer**: No. `mpegCoder` shares exactly the same license (GPL v3) of FFMpeg. This project is totally open-sourced. Although GPLv3 enables coders to add a commercial plan, such a plan would be a burden for me. I will not concern anything about the commercial plan for this project, even sponsorship.
