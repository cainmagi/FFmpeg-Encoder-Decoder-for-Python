To install the pre-compiled package, just run

```shell
pip install mpegCoder==3.1.0b0
```

The PyPI repository is supported since `mpegCoder 3.1.0`. We support from `python 3.5` to `python 3.9`. To check the details of each pre-compiled version, please view the manual installation guides for [Windows](./windows) and [Linux](./linux).

The package installed by this method is shipped with all required dynamic libraries. Users do not need to install any other dependencies in this case. However, if users find that the package could not be imported after the installation, please check the [troubleshooting page](../troubleshooting/installation) first.
