This project is also named as "*FFmpeg-Encoder-Decoder-for-Python*". It is implemented based on [FFMpeg<IconExternalLink/>][link-ffmpeg], [Python-C-API<IconExternalLink/>][link-python-c-api] and [C++11<IconExternalLink/>][link-cpp11]. It is under [GPL v3 License<IconExternalLink/>][git-license], and recommended for researching purposes.

With this package, users could:

* Make use of **all** FFMpeg video encoders and decoders. When decoding a video (or an online stream), like the original FFMpeg (C version), the provided APIs could detect the video format and codec format automatically. When encoding a video, users could control the codec format, bit rate and some other options by setting parameters.
* Work with FFMpeg directly. This project invokes the FFMpeg C APIs in the bottom level. Unlike [ffmpeg-python<IconExternalLink/>][git-ffmpeg-python] and [pyffmpeg<IconExternalLink/>][git-pyffmpeg], our project is not driven by the FFMpeg CLI interfaces. The data format used by this package is [`np.ndarray`<IconExternalLink/>][link-ndarray]. In other words, our project enables users to combine [numpy<IconExternalLink/>][link-numpy] and FFMpeg directly.
* Frame-level APIs. Unlike [pyffmpeg<IconExternalLink/>][git-pyffmpeg], this package is not a simple wrapper of FFMpeg. Users could works on the frame-level APIs. For example, when decoding a video, users could get the data frame-by-frame. Each frame is a 3D [`np.ndarray`<IconExternalLink/>][link-ndarray].
* Pre-compiled package. This package has been pre-compiled by the author. If users download the dependent dynamic libraries (`.so` or `.dll`), they do not need to compile the package by themself.

However, users could not work with this project in such cases:

* Platform limited. Currently, we only support Linux and Windows. The Linux release is pre-compiled on Debian. It has been only tested in Ubuntu, Debian and Windows. In other cases, the pre-compiled library may not work. Users may need to compile the package by themselves.
* Version limited. Currently, our project only works with FFMpeg `4.4`. Users need to download the dependent dynamic libraries to make the package work. The legacy versions of this project supports FFMpeg `3.3`, `3.4.2` and `4.0`. However, the legacy built packages are not technically supported now.
* Audio not supported. Although the original FFMpeg supports both video and audio streams, our project only works on video streams. For example, if a video contains audio streams, our package would omit all audio frames in the bottom level. In other words, you **could not** perform audio analysis now. In the future (`v4`), we may support the audio frame analysis.
* Filters not supported. Although the original FFMpeg supports some video processing tools ([`avfilter`<IconExternalLink/>][link-avfilter] and [`postproc`<IconExternalLink/>][link-postproc]), our implementation drops these modules. Instead, we suggest that users should process the frames with [pillow<IconExternalLink/>][pip-pillow] or [openCV<IconExternalLink/>][pip-opencv]. On the other hand, our implementation still supports frame scaling and re-sampling (supported by [`swscale`<IconExternalLink/>][link-swscale] and [`swresample`<IconExternalLink/>][link-swresample]).
