## Questions and answers

### Plan for audio processing

* **Question**: The audio processing is not supported by `mpegCoder 3.x`. Will it be implemented future?

* **Answer**: Sure. The audio processing would be supported since `mpegCoder 4.x`. But I do not have enough time on this project, so it may take a long time to implement.

### Plan for no-encoding streaming

* **Question**: In `mpegCoder 3.x`, `MpegServer` only support streaming while encoding. Will there be a class for decoding a video while pushing it as a stream?

* **Answer**: No. I believe that using the official FFMpeg is a good enough solution.

### Commercial plan

* **Question**: Will there be a commercial plan for `mpegCoder`?

* **Answer**: No. `mpegCoder` share exactly the same license (GPL v3) of FFMpeg coder. This project is totally open-sourced. I will not concern anything about the commercial plan for this project.
